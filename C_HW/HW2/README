You can use hw2_test.sh to test your homework.

Do the following:

1) hw2_test.sh needs to be executed on linux.cs.uchicago.edu

You can use subversion to checkout the shared repository in your homedirectory on linux.cs.uchicago.edu to get the file.

2) Copy your arb_int.c, arb_int.h and arb_test.c into the directory containing hw2_test.sh

3) go into that directory

4) execute:

./hw2_test.sh


The following will be tested:

- If all files are present and properly named
- If arb_int.c can be compiled with a simple test program (arb_simple.c) and if there are no warning or errors
- If the above does not contain any errors valgrind can detect.

- The same but this time using your own arb_test.c

- Finally, a set of numbers is generated and the output of your program
  (running ./arb_test num1 operation num2) is compared to the correct solution.
